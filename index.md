## About Me

I am a Master student at the Technical University of Denmark, where my focus areas are machine learning and probabilistic modeling. Recently, I finished my second semester
as well as a project with DTU Chemistry on graph-based property estimation using deep learning. I love researching and am always looking for
opportunities to learn and improve myself.

At the moment, I am studying SDEs and their application in Diffusion models where my main
inspiration was the great [Flow Matching paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02747").

## Research Interests

- **Probabilistic Modeling:**  MCMC, Gaussian Processes, GMMs
- **Machine Learning:** AI, Diffusion, Bayesian ML
- **Comp. Sci.:** HPC, MLOps, Python

## Notable Works


- [GraPE-Chem](https://github.com/aerte/GraPE): Graph-based Property Estimation for Chemistry, a python package on top of PyTorch-Geometric.
- **Project:** "Uncertainty Estimation for Federated (Distributed) Learning".
- **Bachelor Thesis:** "Using AI to study Bifurcation in Dynamical Systems".
