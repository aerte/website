## About Me

I am a Master student at the Technical University of Denmark, where my focus areas are machine learning and probabilistic modeling. Recently, I finished my second semester
as well as a project with DTU Chemistry on graph-based property estimation using deep learning. I love researching and am always looking for
opportunities to learn and improve myself.

At the moment, I am studying SDEs and their application in Diffusion models where my main
inspiration was the great [Flow Matching paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02747"). JAX and its
application in physics as well as in numerical algorithms are also very interesting!




## Research Interests

- **Probabilistic Modeling:**  MCMC, Gaussian Processes, GMMs
- **Machine Learning:** AI, Diffusion, Bayesian ML
- **Comp. Sci.:** HPC, MLOps, Python




## Notable Works

- **Project**: Variational Quantum Monte Carlo and the Implementation of ([SPRING](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10190)) in ([LapNet](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00794-x)) using JAX.
- **GraPE-Chem**: Graph-based Property Estimation for Chemistry, a python package on top of PyTorch-Geometric ([github](https://github.com/aerte/GraPE), [pdf](./assets/files/GraPE-Chem-report.pdf)).
- **Project:** "Uncertainty Estimation for Federated (Distributed) Learning".
- **Bachelor Thesis:** "Using AI to study Bifurcation in Dynamical Systems" ([pdf](./assets/files/AI-for-Bifurcations.pdf)).
