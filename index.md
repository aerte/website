## About Me

I am a Master student at the Technical University of Denmark, where my focus areas are machine learning and probabilistic modeling. I love working in or with the current research in ML, and I have developed a bit of a passion for the process of reading theory to building the implemenation.

Outside of my extremely interesting thesis (see below), my personal interests are with time-series data and the application of probabilistic models therein. The process of forecasting can be solved in so many interesting ways, and involves much of ML all at once. Particulary, I found [GraphCast](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/graphcast-ai-model-for-faster-and-more-accurate-global-weather-forecasting/) and [Temporal Fusion Transormers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09363) very interesting reads.




## Research Interests

- **Probabilistic Modeling:**  MCMC, Gaussian Processes, GMMs
- **Machine Learning:** GNNs, QMC, Diffusion, Bayesian ML
- **Comp. Sci.:** HPC, MLOps, Python




## Notable Works

- **Master Thesis**: Enhancing atomistic modeling in Graph Neural Networks through optimized connectivity. GNNs used/improved using our algorithm are primarily [MACE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07697) and [SchNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08566). *More to come soon. :-)*
- **Project**: Variational Quantum Monte Carlo and the Implementation of [SPRING](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10190) in [LapNet](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00794-x) using JAX. A scaling law of VQMC was also explored.
- **GraPE-Chem**: Graph-based Property Estimation for Chemistry, a python package on top of PyTorch-Geometric ([github](https://github.com/aerte/GraPE), [pdf](./assets/files/GraPE-Chem-report.pdf)).
- **Project:** "Uncertainty Estimation for Federated (Distributed) Learning".
- **Bachelor Thesis:** "Using AI to study Bifurcation in Dynamical Systems" ([pdf](./assets/files/AI-for-Bifurcations.pdf)).
